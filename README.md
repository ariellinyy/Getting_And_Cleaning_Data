#####README.md

#####run_analysis.r 
* `The acutal code for getting and cleaning the data, and then generating tinydata.txt`
* `The main 5 steps for this code does are:`
   * `Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.`
   * `Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.`
   * `Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.`
   * `Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.`
   * `From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.`

_`Note that you need set up your work directory ("setwd()") to the folder where your data is located before running this code.`_
