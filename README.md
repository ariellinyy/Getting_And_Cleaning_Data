#####README.md 
* `Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.`

#####CookBook.md 
* `Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.`

#####run_analysis.r 
* `The acutal code for getting and cleaning the data, and then generating tinydata.txt`
* `The main 5 steps for this code does are:`
   * 1. `Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.`
   * 2. `Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.`
   * 3. `Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.`
   * 4. `Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.`
   * 5. `From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.`

`Note that you need set up your work directory ("setwd()") to the folder where your data is located before running this code.`
